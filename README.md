# Bank Account Management System

This project is a simple **Bank Account Management System** built in C++. It allows users to create bank accounts, check account balances, and deposit funds.

## Files

### 1. `Bank.h`
This header file contains the definition of the `Bank` class and its member functions, which manage bank accounts. The class includes functionalities for:
- Adding a new account.
- Getting the balance of an account.
- Adding a balance (deposit).

### 2. `Bank.cpp`
This source file implements the functions defined in the `Bank` class. It handles:
- The logic for adding new accounts.
- Retrieving account balances.
- Updating account balances with deposits.

### 3. `main.cpp`
This file contains the main function, which demonstrates the use of the `Bank` class. It shows how to:
- Add a bank account.
- Check the balance of the account.
- Deposit money into the account and display the new balance.

## How to Compile

To compile the project, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
g++ -o bank_system main.cpp Bank.cpp
```

This will create an executable file named `bank_system`.

## How to Run

After compiling, run the program with:

```bash
./bank_system
```

The program will:
1. Create a new bank account with an initial balance.
2. Show the initial balance.
3. Attempt to deposit money into the account and show the updated balance.

## Example Output

```
Initial balance: 100
Deposit successful. New balance: 900
```

## Dependencies

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements include:
